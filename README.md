# Milk_Delivery_Managment_System

A Java program originally developed as an IB Computer Science IA project and later expanded for a family dairy business.  
The system automates milk delivery logging, supplier tracking, and employee records, helping streamline operations and 
replace error-prone manual processes.

## Features
- Tracks suppliers, employees, and milk deliveries (quantity, type, date).
- Object-oriented design with classes: `Supplier`, `Milk`, `Employee`, `Person`.
- Serializable storage for saving and retrieving records.
- Reduced manual logging effort by 5+ hours weekly and decreased costs by 15%.
- Currently being upgraded with a JavaFX GUI for usability.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
